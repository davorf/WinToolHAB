## Additional notes

- Actions are performed by clicking the button on a respective page
- Before operations are performed, settings validation takes place
- List of files that should be deleted during an OpenHAB update is located in DeleteList.dat. This file can be edited using any text editor and it supports wildcard characters (? and *)
- In case of Restore and Update operations, if OpenHAB is started as a Windows Service and a correct service name is set, application will shut down OpenHAB service, perform chosen operation(s), and, after finishing, start OpenHAB service
- If OpenHAB is started as a Windows Application, it should be stopped before performing Restore or Update operations. In case the application finds **java** and **cmd** processes being run simultaneously, it will stop operation execution and show a message, until OpenHAB is stopped
- When performing a backup operation while OpenHAB is running, some files will be locked and cannot be added to an archive. Application will display these files as an error (red), but a backup archive will be created (without locked files)
